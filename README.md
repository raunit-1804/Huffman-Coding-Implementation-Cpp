# Huffman-Coding-Implementation-Cpp
This is a code which I have written for the implementation of Huffman Coding (lossless compression).
Please note that in this implementation, I have used ```std::string``` whereas to actually see the compression we will need to write on a file in ```binary``` mode otherwise if we write the ```decoded``` string, the size of the file would just increase as the number of characters increase!
