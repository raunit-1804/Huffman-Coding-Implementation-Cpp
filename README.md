# Compression Algorithms
<h3>1. Static Huffman Coding</h3>
<li>This is a code which I have written for the implementation of Huffman Coding (lossless compression).</li>
<li>Note: this implementation, I have used ```std::string``` whereas to actually see the compression we will need to write on a file in ```binary``` mode otherwise if we write the ```decoded``` string, the size of the file would just increase as the number of characters increase!</li>
